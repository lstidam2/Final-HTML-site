        <h4>First, a little bit about me!</h4>
        <div id="biohero"></div>
        <div id="biotext"><p>Hi! I am Lilla (she/her) and I love books! I have always loved books, but my passion for them was renewed in 2020 during quarantine. I started working at a public library in the summer of 2022 and have loved every second!
            When I'm not working you can find me reading, studying for my computer science degree, crocheting, drinking chai with oat milk, or playing games with my friends and family.
            My favorite books are fantasy romance, contemporary fic lit, and graphic novels! You can find lists of my favorite books to read and recommend on my <a href= "lists.html">book lists page</a>.</p>

        <div id="blogtext">
            <h4>The Folk of the Air Trilogy <small>by Holly Black</small></h4>
            <p>The Folk of the Air series begins with <i>The Cruel Prince</i>. The young adult trilogy follows Jude, a mortal girl living in the land of faeries, and Prince Cardan, the seemingly wicked crown prince of the land.
            Jude and Cardan must endure a world of constant poltical battles, betryal and contempt, while navigating their everchanging feelings for each other. </p>
            <p>Overall, a fun, short series with lots of action and political espionage. My series rating: 4/5 </p>
        </div>

        <div id="blogtext">
            <h4>Fourth Wing <small>by Rebecca Yarros</small></h4>
            <p><i>Fourth Wing</i> is a high fantasy with romance and lots of dragons, right up my ally. The story follows Violet as she strives to become a member of the elite dragon riders and get through Xanden, the ruthless wingerleader of the cadre.
            I'm looking forward to slow burn of romance as well as the competition between riders. I expect plenty of betrayal and hidden agendas. 
        Everyone on BookTok has been raving about this book since it's May release, so I am excited to see what the hype is about!</p>
