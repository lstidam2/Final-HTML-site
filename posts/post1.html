        <h2>Ottessa Moshfegh: My Favorite Author</h2>
        <p>Ottessa Charlotte Moshfegh is an American author and novelist. She was born in Croatia to Jewish and Iranian parents and raised in Boston. 
            Her debut novel, Eileen, won the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, and was a fiction finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. </p>
        <h4>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</h4>
        <p><i>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</i> is a 2018 adult novel by Moshfegh, her second novel. It is set in New York City in 2000 and 2001 and follows an unnamed 
            protagonist as she gradually escalates her use of prescription medications in an attempt to sleep for an entire year. <i>My Year</i> is Moshfegh's most popular novel and the first
             of her's I read. The book is popular on BookTok for it's unhinged main character and "manic girl" energy. I loved the unrealiable narrator and turns this book took.
        </p>
        <h4>Eileen</h4>
        <p>Eileen is a 2015 novel by Moshfegh, her first novel. The psychological thriller was adapted into a movie of the same name in 2023.
            The novel is set in 1964 and follows the story of Eileen, a woman planning to escape her life in the New England town of X-ville. Eileen is characterized by self-loathing, 
            depression, and body dysmorphia, all of which developed due to her abusive and neglectful childhood. Again, Moshfegh writes an unrealiable, unpredictable narrator. This book 
            kept me guessing and coming back. </p>
        <h4>Lapvona</h4>
        <p><i>Lapvona</i> is a 2022 book set in the Middle Ages. It follows the life of Marek, a 13-year-old peasant boy who lives in a cruel world of sadism and stink, cannibalism and 
            self-flagellation. There were so many aspects of this book that I didn't expect, but my favorite was the poetic review of the madness and desperation of religion. Moshfegh is perfect 
        at creating terribly disgusting worlds that you would never want to live in, but can't look away from.</p>
