        <h2>A Court of Thorns and Roses: TV Adaptation?</h2>
        <p>The highly popular and critically acclaimed book series "A Court of Thorns and Roses" by author Sarah J Maas has been picked up by Hulu to become a TV series.
            Fans have been split about the announcement. Some are thrilled that their beloved series is soon to come a show, others are concerned on how the magical Book
            will translate to the screen. </p>
        <h4>Casting</h4>
        <p>Many fans, including myself, are concerned about casting. So many of the characters were described to a T in the books. There are fanarts and fancasts out the wazoo. 
            Will the show creators be able to find the perfect trio to play the Bat Boys? Will Feyre be as described? I guess we will just have to wait and see, but I'm hoping 
            the casting department will take a good look at fanart. 
        </p>
        <h4>CGI</h4>
        <p>My biggest concern is with CGI. ACOTAR is a series full of magic fantasy that doesn't translate to the screen well. We've all seen series ruined by terrible CGI. In 
            order to have the magic come to life, the show creators must be willing to spend the time and money it will cost to create good special effects. That's why I almost
            wonder if an animated show would be better than live-action. There are so many great fanartists out there, many who Maas has used for cover art or reshared their work. 
            I sincerly hope this magical series that means so much to so many won't be ruined by bad special effects.
        </p>
